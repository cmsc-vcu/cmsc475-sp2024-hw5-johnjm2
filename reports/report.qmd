# Introduction

The story of the young man unfolds through a journey of self-discovery, passion, and growth. From the strumming of his guitar on a stage filled with passion, navigating adventures on the open sea, to embracing diversity through community engagement, and innovating for a sustainable future in his lab. He explores his creativity in a vibrant art studio, stands resilient against life's challenges, and fosters deep connections with those around him. His journey, marked by curiosity and the empowerment of others, culminates in a moment of serene reflection, symbolizing the harmonious balance he's achieved. Through diverse experiences, he learns the value of each facet of his life, weaving them into a rich tapestry that defines his unique path.

The purpose of the naviagation strategy is for the card viewers to understand a beautify jouney of a young man but going through each picture by clicking arrows.


# Navigation Goals

The navigation goal is for the viewers to understand the story of a young man's journey going through each pictures by clicking arrows.

- Passion for music and the arts, as seen through his immersive guitar performances.
- Adventure-seeking spirit, demonstrated by his ventures on the open sea.
- Innovative mindset, with a focus on sustainable technologies.
- Resilience in the face of challenges, standing strong against adversity.
- Creativity in expression, captured in the vibrant chaos of his art studio.
- Diversity: Celebrates inclusivity and unity through community engagement.
- Journey's End: Symbolizes a harmonious conclusion of diverse life experiences.

# Navigation Elements

- The users would navigate by clicking arrow icons (Left and Right)


# Figma mockup

- Simply click the arrow icons to navigate through each panels.

# User Testing

I shared it with my close friend. I asked him how it looks like and is it user-friendly. He said it is user-friendly and he was able to understand most of themes of the young man's journey. Though, I could improve on making it look better and be more creative.

# Reflection


Working on this project was really enjoyable. It took me about five hours, and I learned a lot, especially about how different parts of the code work together. If I had more time at the start, I would've spent it understanding the code better, which would've made things easier. The best part was seeing the panels change when I navigated through them â€“ it felt great to see my work in action. The hardest part was getting all the different classes to work together smoothly. If I had more time, I'd love to try adding more features and experimenting with new ideas.
